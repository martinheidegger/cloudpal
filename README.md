## Premise

1. Linux evolved in the last 5-10 years to let us create a beautful and powerful Cloud, dedicated to a personal use. This is the next major cycle of Personal Computing, coming after PCs and Mobiles.

1. Despite the dominance of Megascaler / Hyperscalers, the inovation did not stop. Cloud industry is surging with the new entrants in Edge Cloud like Fly.io and with the signifant evolution among the existing ones, like Cloudflare and Fastly.com.

1. There is one area though that neither Hyperscalers nor others are doing today, a **Personal Cloud**. 
This segment of the market does not exist yet, closest to it being the VPS. VPS business existed since 1990s but its target audience was always the techically savvy. Personal Cloud is for the mass consumer.

## Goals of the Personal Cloud
1. People became a product of Facebook, Google and other SaaS app providers. Our goal is to restore the Internet to the conditions when apps do not own us and our data. 
2. We are live in a increasingly multi-device world, with mobile, tablets, PCs, vehicle and home automation computing devices coming online at a rapid pace. We need a personal operating system to manage those devices, put them on one virtual secure network, while logging into it from many places, to exchange data securely between our devices and to run AI and classic algorithms on them, adjusting well to the capabilities. Cloud is one of such devices, with specific capabilities that enahnce operations of other personal devices. Cloud 

Personal Cloud comes with 3 major components: network, compute and data virtualization

## Network, your personal VPN 

### Advantages over traditional VPN
Traditional VPN offers protection of connecting you to the Internet securely. We do that and more.

| Traditional shared VPN | Personal VPN |
| --- | --- |
| Provider has a way to record data decrypted by the VPN | Impossibility of that |
| No logging of your browsing history promise  | Logging impossibility |
| Limited number of devices | Unlimited devices |
| Not possible | Virtual network for all your devices. Think Airdrop between any of your devices, no matter where they are |

### Common features of a VPN

- **Secure your line** on public WiFi (cafe, airport, etc.). Those are the feeding grounds even for kids learning to be hackers.
- **No snooping by your internet provider (ISP)**. They see and may record all your browsing history. Yikes!

### Premium features

- **No snooping by the websites**. By default, the websites you visit will see the same IP address that they would see when you are not using our solution. We offer an option of a temporary IP address that they will see instead. Gives you that extra protection.
- **Block ads in apps and browser**. Add do a full surveilance on us. This option will blocs many of the ads for all of your devices, without you needeing to do anything. No more installing browser extensions, ad blockers, etc. We feel bad about advertisement supported services, but perhaps their time is over. Personal Cloud offers alternative apps that never take your data.
- **Pay with cryptocurrnecy** to avoid giving us your name and card when signing up.
- **Firewall** your devices may already have some protection from hackers. But you may want more control and this will give you that extra peace of mind, protecting all your connected devices at once.
- IPv6 vs IPv4

### Not supported
This solution is built of privacy. If you're doing it to mask potentially illegal activity, don't - you will get in trouble. This may include:

- Torrenting of movies and other copyrighted materials
- Geolocation switching to watch Netflix shows which are not available in your home country

It is also important to understand the limitations on our ability to protect your privacy:

- **Defence from us**. We do not have an ability to access your data, secret keys or network activity. But as we accept payments from you, we may know who you are, if you use the credit card payment mechanism. If you do not want that, pay us please with cryptocurrency if your jurisdiction allows it.
- **Defence from the landlord**. With our solution the capability of the vendor, that is us, to know what your are doing is removed as you operate on your own Virtual PC. The capability of the Data Center is significantly reduced. What remains is:
    - an ability for the Data Center to take the operating memory snapshot of your personal virtual machine and try to deduce some information from it. Note that all cloud providers have this capability. Yet, the solution for this is coming - encrypted memory for virtual machines will be possible in about a year. Note that this relates only to data in RAM, while the data kept in storage are always encrypted.
    - you will have an ability to choose the Data Center in which your Virtual PC will run.
    - your home router or your mobile on a cell phone network will reveal their network IP address to the Data Center's network. This is standard with the IP protocol used by the Internet. This does not reveal any transmitted data, just the source IP address (e.g. router) and the destination IP which is the address of your virtual machine. You can't hide the destination, but if you want to hide your source IP address, your need to look for Tor or other similar solutions. 
- **Government agency** may compel the Data Center to perform the above actions, using the due process or covertly.
