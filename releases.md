CloudPal development plan (early draft)
Take a look at issues for detailed plans for different parts of CloudPal.

## Flow sanctuary 
*Network*. Get all your devices connected on your network.
Nowadays we live on the network, and as network has become our home, 
it must be treated as sanctuary, like our dwellings are. This is your human right. 
Be assured no surveilance of your flows is possible now or in the future.
CloudPal is your walls, windows and doors. 

## Altar of being
*Data*. We generate data at the astounding rates. 
They reflect wo we are and who we are becoming. 
We must feel and know that data is treated like the alter of our being, 
that it is a sanctuary that can't ever be violated.
This is our human right.

## Intelligence Moon
AI extending our intelligence in a way that helps our growth 
Our intelligence is enhanced, extended and multiplied via digital means. 
It must be protected, as the contents of our brains.

## We the people
*Decentralized Governance*. As CloudPal stabilizes, moving to a decentralized decision making process is paramount.

## Patrons of arts
*Long term evolution*. To ensure long term evolution of CloudPal, 
for the sake of each human progresses on the [Maslow's pyramid of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), 
we need a decentralized community-driven funding of benefitial projects
