# Why blockchain is essential for CloudPal

## Data must be trusted
If AI is to make any suggestions for your health, for diagnosis or healing, 
it needs to be assured of veracity of data. Otherwise the developer will incur legal liabilities
so Data in CLoudPal has to have clearly marked lineage, and be virgin

## Protecting Privacy 
In a shade of a tree, both saints and robbers find refuge. 
Tree can't take credit from the ministry of saints and pay for the sins of the robbers.
Blockchian is used by CloudPal to distance R&D team from the demands of the governments 
to uncover the privacy of CloudPal users.

## Governance 
Decentralized governance as used effectively now in DeFI to 
- achieve fairness in decision making satisfying the needs of different ecosystem players
- to significantly reduce the liability for the R&D team

## DeFi for CloudPal
- Decentralized Exchange. 
Uniswap demonstrated (and many like Aave followed) that Decentralized Exchange can work without a traditional order book,  
generate significant liquidity, outsourcing it to others and thus democratize profits generation, 
which normally goes to a small number of parties on centralized exchange.
CloudPal will likely have several tokens and an ability to access liquidity for them will be essential.
Tokens will represent different forms of compute, bandwidth and storage and will be used for governance.
- Lending 
DeFi can help data centers fund the build up and growth of their infrastructure

## Accounting for cloud resources utilized by users
This way the billing can be trusted and decentralized. 
This is important for the community to create usage analysis and budgeting software, billing alerts and other things current cloud providers offer

## Trust in CloudPal OS
People need to be able to trust the billing, trust that the software was not compromised, 
no malware was injected and no backdoors were created either inadvertently or intentionally.
For that we need the reproducible builds, sealed and verifiable on the blockchain.

## Token supply
Tokens emission and burning is tied to the data center capacity fluctuations. 

## Funding ongoing R&D
10% of token emission goes to CloudPal foundation for the decentralized funding of projects that benefit the ecosystem.
