# Single-tenant Data for AI / ML and apps
Eliminates the dependency on Big Tech, all the data is stored both on your devices and in your personal cloud. Full mobility between data centers, to avoid a lock-in into one provider. Zero surveilance, full privacy as only you can look at your own data, and full control over your own data (no deplatforming possible).


## Cost-effective data storage  
    * storage for source datasets
    * intermediate storage, e.g. enhanced or synthetic datasets, or temporary datasets 
    * storage for trained models (zero-copy use via streaming)
    * common data sets (e.g. list of medicines) 

## Less time and effort administrating 
    * Data explorer
    * Search engine 

## Commercial model, incentives and payments
    * dataset providers
    * AI models providers
    * data centers

## AI / ML (upcoming)
    * federated coordination
    * decentralized federation
    * integration with leading ML tools

## Database
    * Multi-master leaderless database (tolerant to network interruptions)
    * Multi-device support, including cloud, desktop and mobile devices
    * Offline support - works even without an internet connection
    * Auto-indexing
    * Structured and semi-structured data
    * Multiple interfaces
      * DynamoDB compaible API
      * LevelDB (LelevUP) API
      * (upcoming) ANSI SQL Use SQL for all your data, structured or semi-structured, including support for joins across data types, databases and external tables.
      * (upcoming) JDBC, ODBC
    
## Data pipelines
    * Bulk data consumption
    * Real-time streaming: 
        * fast sequential loads
        * sparse data download, fast-forward, rewind
        * Accelerated streaming via bittorrent-like bandwidth sharing
    * Event-based data consumption, e.g. for processing or for UI updates
    * User-defined functions.  Scripting to process data with in-engine JavaScript functions to perform custom calculations.
        * Scale scripting via multiple parallel micro-services
    * Time-travel. Easily access historical data or roll back without manual backups

## Collaboration and data sharing
    * Share live datasets with your partners with a single source-of-truth proofs
    * (Upcoming) Use like Google Drive, Dropbox, but without Google or anyone else in the middle 
    * (Upcoming) Google Docs alternative 
    * (Upcoming) Share parts of the datasets, permisssioned for different data consumers

## Data governanace 
    * Data protection
        * immutability and data versioning
        * data anonymization 
        * data minimization 
    * Guarantee for data validity 
        * verified data origin (doctor credentials, device signature)
    * Schema
    * Standardized storage formats 
    * Support for structured and semi-structured data types, including IoT data

## Data marketplace for training models (upcoming)
    * Data marketplace (catalogs, and commercial consumption of data)
    * Schema marketplace (tokenized NFT)
    * Data accounting for billing
