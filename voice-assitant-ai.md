# Voice asisstant 
We had decades of sci-fi books and movies in which people talk to computers. 
Finally voice is here and in mass. But Houston, we have a problem! 
All those utterances from our our bedrooms and living rooms are going to BigTech.

I grew up in the former Soviet Union, and we wispered at home, 
as we knew then that the walls were listening.
Now they are listening to us in the US and everywhere in teh world and we gladly put ourselves
under the total surveilance.

Well we can do better. We must do better.

## Voice asisstant pipelines
Assistant today typically goes through 4 stages.

### Wake word listening
Asisstant in the form of a smart speaker, Siri on iPhone or Google Assistant on Android
must always be listening to hear your call, Alexa, Hey Siri, Ok Google, etc.

### Voice to text
Then your voice is trascribed to text. This is the most difficult operation and is the heaviest.

### Understanding your command
After that assistant needs to understand what you wanted,
and for that it uses the AI to map the transcribed text into one of the so called intents. 
Intent could be - reserve a seat in the restaurant. 
And it coudl be said in many ways, so a bunch of possible (but not exaustive list) of uterances 
is needed.
